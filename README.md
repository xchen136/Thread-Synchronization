# Thread-Synchronization 
A random matching game that uses semaphore to synchronize processes.

"Project Idea"

Match can only happen when there are 3 women with 1 man, or 3 men with 1 woman arriving in the room. 
The match will happen between the single gender person with the opposite gender person who arrives second. 
The single gender person's arrival order is not taken into account. For instance, if there are 3men 1woman, 
then the 1woman will match with Men#2 who comes in 2nd within the men. 
They will not know their arrival order after they enter the room. 
Once a match happens, everyone needs to leave the room but the unmatched participants have to wait on line and enter another match.
